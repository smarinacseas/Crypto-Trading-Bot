Solana Trading Bot

Overview:
This project is an attempt at creating a Solana trading bot for self-learning purposes. The primary goals are to:
- Deepen understanding of blockchain development.
- Improve Python programming skills.
- Experiment with accessing and utilizing financial/blockchain data feeds.
- Develop the capability to perform automated trading actions based on real-time and historical market data.

The bot is designed to be flexible, allowing for the implementation of different trading strategies and the ability to backtest these strategies using historical market data.

Features:
- Real-time Market Data: Connect to WebSocket data feeds to receive real-time market updates.
- Automated Trading: Execute trades based on predefined strategies.
- Flexible Strategy Implementation: Easily implement and switch between different trading strategies.
- Backtesting: Test strategies against historical market data to evaluate their performance.
- Secure Transactions: Handle private keys securely to ensure safe trading.

Utility Functions:
- Utility functions for common tasks are implemented in `src/utils.py`.

WebSocket Client:
- The WebSocket client in `src/websocket_client.py` handles real-time data feeds.

Strategy Implementation:
- The `src/strategy.py` file contains the implementation of trading strategies. Define multiple strategies and switch between them as needed.

Backtesting:
- Implement backtesting functionality in `src/backtesting.py` to evaluate strategies using historical market data.

Future Improvements:
- Enhanced Security: Implement advanced security measures for key management.
- Advanced Strategies: Develop and test more sophisticated trading strategies.
- Comprehensive Backtesting: Integrate a robust backtesting framework to improve strategy evaluation.
- User Interface: Develop a simple user interface to control and monitor the bot.
